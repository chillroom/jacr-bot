The best freaking [dubtrack.fm](https://dubtrack.fm) bot in the world.

#IMPORTANT NOTICE#

Please do not edit the server.js file. Only Nitro Ghost can edit this. IF something goes wrong in this file, it brings down the API server as well as the bot. Although we are using Jenkins as a build server, it will not revert back to the old bot if there's code errors, or if the bot closes itself from a later invoked error, such as triggering a command.
