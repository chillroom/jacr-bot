You need a GitHub account for this.

# Getting started
1. See config.js for a list of environment variables required to be INIT'd. You may edit this file directly.
2. `node bot/index.js` to start the dubtrack bot.
3. You need Go installed for Lastfm to work (bot will crash without the "lastfm" binary). Build bot/events/lastfm.go to the same directory. Currently hardcoded for qaisjp's system.
